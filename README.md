BASIC Games (from 1978)

Computing nostalgia. Many of these come from the david ahl book BASIC computer games. I can get most of them to work in [Chipmunk Basic](http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/) on the command line.
Computer Art is from an old book from the thrift store (need to look up title and info) but currently does not work. Needs work.
Some are my own code (particularly random rollers).

I may add more programs over time.
