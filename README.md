BASIC Games (from 1978)

Computing nostalgia. Many of these come from the david ahl book BASIC computer games. I can get most of them to work in [Chipmunk Basic](http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/) on the command line.
Some are my own code (particularly random rollers).

I may add more programs over time.
